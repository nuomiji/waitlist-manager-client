# Restaurant Waitlist Management App

Welcome to the Restaurant Waitlist Management App! This application is designed to help restaurant customers conveniently join a waitlist, receive real-time notifications when their table is ready, and track their position in the queue. The app provides a simple and user-friendly experience for managing the wait for a table at participating restaurants.

Open your browser and go to https://waitlist-manager-client-618b1c8585d4.herokuapp.com to start using the app.

## Features

- **Join the Waitlist**: Customers can quickly add themselves to the restaurant's waitlist with basic information such as name, party size, and contact details.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive notifications when your table is ready, helping you make the most of your waiting time.
- **Track Your Position**: Keep track of your position in the waitlist so you know how much longer you'll have to wait.

## Current Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

- **Basic State Management**: The app currently uses basic state management with React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. This is fine for a small app but may not scale well as the app grows in complexity.
- **Limited UI/UX**: While the user interface is functional, it could benefit from improvements in accessibility features and a more reactive user experience.
- **Monolithic Components**: Some components contain both UI logic and business logic, which may make them harder to maintain as the app grows.

### Future Improvements

- **State Management**: As the app expands, we plan to introduce a more sophisticated state management solution, such as Redux or the Context API, to efficiently handle more complex global states.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: We aim to improve the app's accessibility, adding support for features such as keyboard navigation, improved screen reader compatibility, and a more polished, reactive design to enhance the user experience.
- **Component Separation**: To make the codebase more maintainable, we will gradually refactor larger components into smaller, more focused units, separating UI presentation from business logic where appropriate.
